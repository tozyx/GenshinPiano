warning you, stranger
unpacking, right?
decompile, right?
I warn you, stranger

In principle
you shouldn't have unpacked
You shouldn't even see these lines

warn you

stranger

The fruits of others' labor
from nothing

one letter
one line of code
one class
one project
every compilation
every debug
every build

Do you understand
stranger





Oh
I have open sourced
that's all right

bless you
stranger

I'm glad you are interested in the source code

If you have a heart to learn
Nice to discuss with you
I wish you a bright future and progress together!

if you have bad intentions
So
I curse you, stranger




you who love to learn
please don't decompile
No comments after all
Please go to GitHub

because of java
We meet!
friend
Would you like a cup of java?

present
may have changed
May be vicissitudes

I am still grateful to the kind you
May our future be well

Good night
Sweet dreams!
We will meet in a dream!
Must be smiling!
